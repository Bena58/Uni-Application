## Notes on Rankings & Safety

- **Rankings:** Where exact subject positions weren‚Äôt published on a single static page, I cited the official subject tables and country filters (QS 2025; THE 2025; ARWU/Shanghai subject lists). Always cross-check the specific year/subject when you apply. ([Top Universities](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-subject-rankings/computer-science-information-systems?countries=au&utm_source=chatgpt.com "QS World University Rankings for Computer Science and ..."))
    
- **Safety:** **Australia ranked #19/163** on the Global Peace Index 2024; the **2025** report confirms global trends and Australia remains among the safer developed nations. City crime/safety indices use **Numbeo 2025** snapshots (Crime lower is better; Safety higher is better).

## What to do next (fast path)

1. Shortlist **USyd, UNSW, Melbourne, ANU, UQ** (apply to 3‚Äì4); add **one value option** (QUT/UWA/UOW/RMIT).
    
2. For each, open the **official course page** to confirm: exact **IELTS bands**, **2026 intake window**, and the **fee line** for your specific course code.
    
3. Prepare: transcript + proof of math, IELTS report, passport, statement, CV.
    
4. Plan finances with the **AUD‚ÜîUSD** rate above and the city monthly ranges (housing drives most variance). ([Xe](https://www.xe.com/en-us/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=AUD&utm_source=chatgpt.com "1 USD to AUD - Convert US Dollars to Australian Dollars"))
