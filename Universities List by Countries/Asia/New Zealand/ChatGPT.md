### Tiny print (how to read the money)

- Where universities price **per 15-point course** or **per-point**, I annualized to **120 points** (typical full-time) and added the official **Student Services Levy** where shown, then converted at **1 USD ≈ NZ$1.73 (Sep 25–28, 2025)** for a reasonable USD estimate. Always defer to the fee line on your **Offer of Place**. ([Times Higher Education (THE)](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/cms-academic/sites/default/files/institution_downloads/2025-01/AUT%20International%20Student%20Prospectus%202025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AUT International Student Prospectus ..."))
