## Quick How-To (Next Steps)

1. **Shortlist 4–5** (HKUST/HKU/CUHK/CityU/PolyU) based on cost + vibe.
    
2. **Create accounts** in each portal and calendar the **early/main deadlines** above.
    
3. **Prepare IELTS proof** (your 7.5 is excellent), **math syllabi** (calc), transcripts, and any **coding portfolio**.
    
4. **Scholarships**: check “entrance scholarships” sections and submit any **extra essays** where optional.
    
5. **Visa**: once an offer lands, start **Entry for Study** with the university as sponsor; allow lead time and follow IMMD rules on employment.
