# An Analytical Report on Top Computer Science Bachelor's Programs in Taiwan for International Applicants

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the top universities in Taiwan offering Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and related fields, specifically tailored for an international student with a strong academic profile. The evaluation is based on a multi-faceted methodology, prioritizing Computer Science program reputation, city and country safety, affordability and value, and the quality of international student support. All financial data is presented in New Taiwan Dollars (TWD) and U.S. Dollars (USD), based on an exchange rate of **1 USD = 32.5 TWD** as of January 15, 2025.

Taiwan's higher education landscape for technology is dominated by a clear upper echelon, colloquially known as the "Big Four": National Taiwan University (NTU), National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), and National Cheng Kung University (NCKU). These institutions consistently lead national and global rankings in engineering and computer science, offering world-class research opportunities and commanding significant prestige.1 Following this tier are highly respected, practice-oriented institutions such as National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) and National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), which provide exceptional industry connections and an outstanding return on investment.3

A significant strategic advantage for prospective students is the Hsinchu tech hub, home to both NTHU and NYCU. This area, often referred to as Taiwan's "Silicon Valley," hosts the Hsinchu Science Park and is the operational heart of global semiconductor giants like TSMC. This geographic concentration offers students unparalleled access to internships, industry-led projects, and premier career prospects upon graduation.5

From a safety perspective, Taiwan presents a unique profile. Daily life in its major cities is exceptionally safe, with user-reported data from platforms like Numbeo consistently showing very low crime rates and high safety indices.6 However, the nation's ranking in the Global Peace Index is moderated by geopolitical factors, particularly its score in "relations with neighboring countries".8 This distinction is critical: while personal safety is among the highest in the world, applicants should be aware of the broader regional context.

Financially, Taiwan offers one of the best value propositions globally for a top-tier technology education. Annual tuition fees for international students at even the most prestigious universities are remarkably affordable, often ranging from $3,000 to $4,000 USD.10 When combined with a low cost of living and robust scholarship opportunities, the overall return on investment is exceptionally high.

Furthermore, Taiwan's government has implemented favorable policies to retain international talent. A key policy allows graduates to extend their Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) for up to two years to seek employment, providing a clear and supportive pathway from education to a professional career in a global technology hub.12

## Detailed University Profiles

### üåü DREAM SCHOOL: National Taiwan University (NTU) - Taipei, Taiwan

Why this is the #1 CS program in Taiwan:

National Taiwan University's position as the premier institution for Computer Science in Taiwan is unequivocal, built on a foundation of global academic recognition, immense prestige, a legacy of influential alumni, and unparalleled opportunities within Taiwan's capital.

- **Global CS Ranking:** NTU is the only Taiwanese university to consistently rank within the world's top 100 for Computer Science in the most respected international evaluations. It is ranked #=91 by QS World University Rankings by Subject 2025 and in the 101-125 band by Times Higher Education for 2025.13 This global standing reflects a high volume of impactful research and a world-class academic environment.
    
- **Reputation and Prestige:** As the flagship university of Taiwan, NTU commands the highest academic and employer reputation in the country.1 A degree from NTU is a significant credential that is recognized and respected by top technology firms and academic institutions worldwide.

_"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."_

#### üìä Reality Check

While NTU is an inspiring goal, applicants must approach it with a clear understanding of its extreme selectivity. Publicly cited acceptance rates, such as 43%, can be misleading for international applicants.20 These figures often include domestic applicants who have already passed the highly competitive national university entrance examinations, thus pre-screening the applicant pool. The true acceptance rate for international students applying directly is significantly lower, likely in the single digits, making admission exceptionally competitive.22

Successful applicants typically demonstrate a profile of near-perfect academic achievement (GPA of 3.9/4.0 or higher), outstanding standardized test scores (if submitted), and, most importantly, a record of exceptional talent. This can include winning medals in prestigious international competitions like the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) or the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), which can grant direct admission pathways.23 To stand out, a candidate must present a compelling and well-articulated statement of purpose, secure powerful letters of recommendation from recognized academics, and ideally, showcase a portfolio of personal coding projects, research experience, or other tangible evidence of passion and aptitude for computer science.

## General Information for International Students

### Visa and Alien Resident Certificate (ARC)

Successfully admitted international students must navigate a two-step process to legally reside and study in Taiwan.

First, applicants must apply for a **Resident Visa** before departing for Taiwan. This application is submitted to the nearest R.O.C. (Taiwan) Embassy, Consulate, or Representative Office in their home country. Key documents required for this application typically include the official admission letter from the university, a valid passport, a recent health certificate, and proof of sufficient funds (a bank statement showing at least TWD 200,000 or approximately $6,000 USD is a common requirement).30 The processing time for the visa can take several weeks, so it is imperative to apply well in advance of the planned travel date.

Second, upon arriving in Taiwan with the Resident Visa, students must apply for an **Alien Resident Certificate (ARC)** within 15 days.92 The ARC is the primary identification card for foreign residents in Taiwan and is required for opening a bank account, signing up for the National Health Insurance program, and obtaining a work permit. This application is processed at a local service center of the National Immigration Agency (NIA).91

### Work Rights and Post-Study Options

Taiwan offers a supportive environment for international students who wish to gain work experience during and after their studies.

During the academic program, international students are permitted to work part-time for a maximum of **20 hours per week** during the semester and full-time during official summer and winter breaks.94 Before starting any employment, students must apply for and receive a

**Work Permit** from the Workforce Development Agency. Working without this permit can result in significant fines (TWD 30,000 to TWD 150,000) and potential deportation.97

After graduation, Taiwan provides a clear pathway for students to transition into the local workforce. Graduates can apply to extend their ARC for job-seeking purposes. This extension was recently increased, allowing for an initial one-year stay, which can be extended for an additional year, for a **total of up to two years** to find suitable employment.12 Once a graduate secures a job offer, their employer assists them in applying for a full-time work permit. The government uses a points-based system for recent graduates, which evaluates qualifications such as degree level, salary, work experience, and Chinese language proficiency. A total score of 70 points is required to be eligible for the permit, a threshold that is very achievable for graduates from Taiwan's top universities.98 This structured and supportive post-study work policy makes Taiwan a highly attractive destination for students aiming to launch a global career in technology.
