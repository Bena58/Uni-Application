## Notes & next steps (honest gaps)

- **Exact subject rankings (QS CS / THE Eng&Tech / ARWU CS):** These change annually and vary by system; I did not enumerate every number for every school in this pass. If you want, I can add a one-line rank triple (QS/THE/ARWU) per school from the latest 2024–25 cycles.
    
- **City safety numbers beyond Beijing/Shenzhen:** I cited Numbeo’s 2025 list that includes those two; values for Xi’an/Suzhou/Chengdu/Harbin can be added quickly from the same source.
    
- **BIT tuition:** latest official page lists structure but hides the exact number; I used the last posted figure from BIT’s brochure and flagged it. We can confirm with the 2026 cycle notice once posted.
    
- **Acceptance rates:** rarely published by Chinese publics; left as “not published”.

If you want, I can (a) plug in exact QS/THE/ARWU subject ranks for each school, (b) verify city safety numbers for Xi’an/Suzhou/Chengdu/Harbin, and (c) pull precise, current tuition & subscores for any one you shortlist next.
