# An Expert Report on Top Computer Science Bachelor's Programs in South Korea for International Students

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the premier undergraduate Computer Science programs in the Republic of Korea, with a specific focus on their suitability for international applicants. South Korea has firmly established itself as a global leader in technology and innovation, a status reflected in the world-class quality of its higher education institutions, particularly in STEM fields.1 Universities such as KAIST, Seoul National University, and POSTECH are not only national powerhouses but also globally competitive, offering rigorous, research-intensive curricula and strong pathways to industry.3

For international students, South Korea presents a compelling value proposition. The nation is exceptionally safe, with a high Global Peace Index ranking and low urban crime rates, ensuring a secure environment for academic and personal growth.5 Furthermore, a significant finding of this analysis is the accessibility of elite education. The leading science and technology-focused national universities, including KAIST, POSTECH, and GIST, offer extensive scholarship packages that often cover full tuition and provide living stipends for nearly all admitted international undergraduates.7 This creates a unique landscape where the most prestigious programs are often the most affordable, shifting the primary barrier to entry from financial capacity to academic merit.

The South Korean government actively supports the recruitment and retention of high-caliber international talent through streamlined visa processes and enhancements to post-study work opportunities, particularly for graduates in high-demand fields like computer science.10 This forward-looking policy environment, combined with direct industry collaboration with global tech giants like Samsung and Hyundai, provides graduates with outstanding career prospects both within Korea and internationally.1

## National Policies for International Students: Visa and Career Opportunities

### Student Visa (D-2)

International students enrolling in a Bachelor's degree program in South Korea must obtain a D-2-2 student visa.23 The application process is initiated after the student receives a Certificate of Admission (CoA) from their chosen university.

- **Application Process:** Applicants must submit the CoA, a valid passport, visa application form, proof of financial stability, and other required documents to the Korean embassy or consulate in their country of residence. The proof of financial stability can often be met by the scholarship award letter from universities like KAIST, POSTECH, or GIST that provide comprehensive funding.72
    
- **Processing Time:** The processing time typically ranges from two to four weeks, but it is advisable to apply at least two to three months before the intended travel date.
    
- **Alien Registration Card (ARC):** Upon arrival in South Korea, all students staying for more than 90 days must apply for an Alien Registration Card (ARC) at a local immigration office. This card serves as the official ID for foreigners in Korea and is required for various activities, including opening a bank account and obtaining a mobile phone plan.73
    

### Work Rights During Studies

The South Korean government permits D-2 visa holders to engage in part-time work, but this is a regulated privilege designed to ensure that academic pursuits remain the student's primary focus.

- **Work Permit:** Students must obtain a specific part-time work permit from the immigration office before starting any employment. Working without this permit can lead to penalties, including the cancellation of the student visa.25
    
- **Eligibility:** Generally, students must have resided in Korea for at least six months (i.e., completed one semester) and maintain a satisfactory academic record (e.g., a minimum GPA of 2.0 or higher, depending on the institution).24
    
- **Hour Limits:** During the academic semester, students are typically limited to a maximum of 25 hours of work per week. During official university vacation periods, this limit is lifted, allowing for full-time work.24
    

### Post-Study Work Options

South Korea has demonstrated a strong commitment to retaining talented international graduates, particularly in STEM fields, by enhancing its post-study work visa policies.

- **D-10 "Job-Seeker" Visa:** This is the primary visa for graduates wishing to remain in Korea to find employment. It allows graduates to stay in the country for an initial period to search for a job related to their field of study.74
    
- **Recent Enhancements:** The government has recently extended the maximum validity of the D-10 visa for graduates of science and engineering programs to three years, a significant increase from the previous limit. This policy change reflects a strategic effort to attract and integrate high-tech talent into the Korean economy.10
    
- **Pathway to Residency:** For graduates who secure a professional position, the D-10 visa can be converted to a long-term employment visa (e.g., E-7). The government has also expanded and expedited pathways to permanent residency for "outstanding foreign science and technology talents," making a long-term career in South Korea an increasingly viable option for graduates from top universities.10
