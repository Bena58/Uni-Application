### **Detailed Profiles**

üåü **DREAM SCHOOL: National University of Singapore (NUS)** - Singapore

**Why this is the #1 CS program in Singapore:**

- **Global CS Ranking:** #9 worldwide (QS 2025), consistently placing it among the global elite like MIT, Stanford, and CMU.
    
- **Acceptance Rate:** Estimated at 5-7% overall, and likely lower for its flagship Computer Science program, making it one of the most selective in the world.
    
- **Notable Alumni:** Tan Min-Liang (CEO of Razer), Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft, though he attended for a short program), and numerous founders of billion-dollar startups.
    
- **Unique Opportunities:** Home to world-class research labs in AI, cybersecurity, and data science. The NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) program allows students to intern at tech startups in hubs like Silicon Valley, Shanghai, and Stockholm for up to a year.
    

**üìä Reality Check**

- **Acceptance Rate:** Extremely low. International applicants require stellar high school grades (e.g., perfect or near-perfect IB/A-Level scores), and often showcase achievements in international Olympiads (Math, Physics, Informatics) or significant research/project experience.
    
- **What makes successful applicants stand out:** A clear and demonstrated passion for computing beyond academics, exceptional mathematical aptitude, and a compelling personal essay that details specific interests and ambitions in the field.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**

- **Tuition Grant:** The tuition fees listed for international students are subsidized rates after the mandatory Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Tuition Grant. Recipients of this grant are required to work in Singapore for three years after graduation.
    
- **Data Accuracy:** All financial figures are based on the 2025-26 academic year and are subject to change. Rankings are from the latest available cycles. Safety indices are updated periodically.
    
- **Application Process:** Singaporean universities have a highly centralized and competitive application process. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. A holistic review of academic and co-curricular achievements is conducted.
