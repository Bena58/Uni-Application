## Notes on English Test Fit (Your IELTS: **Overall 7.5; W 6.5; R 7.5; L 8.0; S 7.0**)

- **Meets:** NUS (Overall ≥6.5 and **W/R ≥6.5**) — ✅; NTU (Overall ≥6.0, **W ≥6.0**) — ✅; DigiPen SG (Overall ≥6.5, **no sub <6.0**) — ✅; JCU SG (Overall 6.0, **no band <6.0**) — ✅.
    
- **Potential Flag:** **SMU** often signals **IELTS 7.0 overall** for some international routes; if a **Writing ≥7.0** subscore is enforced for your qualification, **your Writing 6.5** may be _just below_ — plan an appeal or consider retaking if targeting SMU as a top pick. ([Nottingham Trent University](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/international/your-application/entry-requirements/english-language-requirements?utm_source=chatgpt.com "English language requirements"))
    
- **Others (SIT/SUSS/SUTD/Curtin/SIM-UoL):** Requirements vary by programme and route; thresholds around **6.5–7.0** are common. Always reconfirm the programme-specific page.

## What I’d do next (if you want me to refine):

- Lock **exact** application open/close dates for your passport/qualification (IB vs A-Levels vs U.S. etc.).
    
- Confirm **programme-specific IELTS subscores** for SMU/SIT/SUTD to see if your **Writing 6.5** triggers any conditional offers.
    
- Add personalised **scholarship calendar** (deadlines + required materials).
    

If you want, I can also convert this into a one-page PDF shortlist with links and an application checklist for Oct–Mar.
