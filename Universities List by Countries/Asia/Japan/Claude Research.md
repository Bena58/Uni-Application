## Critical insights and recommendations

### Programs to Note

**Important Finding:** The University of Tokyo's PEAK program, despite Tokyo's #1 CS research ranking, does NOT offer Computer Science—it's a liberal arts program only. Kyoto iUP provides the only true Computer Science degree in English at an imperial university.

### Best Value Options

1. **Most Affordable:** Kyushu, Nagoya, Tohoku (national universities ~$3,500 tuition)
2. **Best Balance:** Ritsumeikan ISSE (dedicated CS program, accessible admission)
3. **Most International-Friendly:** APU (50% international students)

### For Your IELTS Profile (7.5 Overall, 6.5 Writing)
